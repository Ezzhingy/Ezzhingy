<h1 align="center">Heyo 👋, Eugene Zhang here.</h1>

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer currently enrolled as a freshman in the Honours Computer Science Co-op Program at the University of Waterloo.

## 👀 Talk to me about:
- Improving website design using React, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript. Next.js on the horizon!
- Backend web development. Intermediate in Flask and now tackling Node.js + Express.js!
- Data structures and algorithms. Currently using Python! Maybe switching to C++ for faster compilation times 👀
